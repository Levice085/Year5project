# AI-Powered Urban Heat Island (UHI) Model

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project is a comprehensive environmental modeling system designed to analyze **10 years of Landsat data** for temperature prediction[cite: 20]. [cite_start]By leveraging **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Python**, the system identifies Urban Heat Island (UHI) patterns to support climate intelligence and sustainability efforts[cite: 6, 18].

##  Key Features
* [cite_start]**Longitudinal Analysis:** Processes a decade-long dataset of satellite imagery to track temperature changes over time[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Machine Learning Integration:** Implements a **Random Forest model** specifically tuned for temperature prediction[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Automated Pipelines:** Features a fully automated workflow for data preprocessing and feature engineering, reducing manual intervention[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**Interactive Visualization:** Produces visual dashboards and spatial insights to make complex data accessible[cite: 23].

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
* [cite_start]**Language:** Python [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]**Geospatial Processing:** Google Earth Engine (GEE) [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]**Machine Learning:** Random Forest (Scikit-learn) [cite: 21]
* [cite_start]**Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, Cross-Validation [cite: 44]

## ⚙️ Methodology
1.  [cite_start]**Data Ingestion:** Retrieval of Landsat satellite data via Google Earth Engine[cite: 18, 20].
2.  [cite_start]**Preprocessing:** Automated cleaning, masking, and feature extraction[cite: 22].
3.  [cite_start]**Model Training:** Training a Random Forest regressor to predict surface temperatures[cite: 21].
4.  [cite_start]**Evaluation:** The model was rigorously evaluated using **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error), **cross-validation**, and **feature analysis** to ensure accuracy[cite: 44].

## 📊 Results
* [cite_start]Successfully built a full ML pipeline for environmental modeling[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]Generated actionable spatial insights and dashboards[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]Project findings were presented at academic exhibitions[cite: 45].
